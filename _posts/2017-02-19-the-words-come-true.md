After more than a half year living in this new country, things become less interesting and exiting than the moment I just arrived here. I believe for everyone, the first moment when they arrived the States, he was definitely so exited to death. Everything is new and clean here, but things are not that good after he lives here for several months. Same as me. Everything is becoming just life, that’s it, nothing more. However, I met someone while I was drowning.

The words I wrote here month ago just came true. Yes, she loves me, and she can kiss me for the whole night without stopping. I literally have no idea how things get here, and the only thing I know is just we are together now. Well, love is odd, but I don’t know whether this is a good thing or not. 

As a student who doesn’t want to study at all and the only thing attracts her is having fun and hanging out with friends, she does not suit me at all. Well, she is kind of smart, but she should be an artist instead of a mathematic. Everything she does just like what artists are doing. Meaningless, pointless, judging, hating, everything. 

There is one thing, I feel nothing with people. After I shut down my heart several years ago, I don’t feel anything since then. I tried once during these years, but I failed just like fishes trying to fly without water. So I embraced myself. Now, I even do not know whether I want to open it or not. I don’t feel. I don’t know whether the reason is  that is too hard to open my heart or I just don’t want to open it. I always know there always is an end for happiness, and no one can be together forever. There is no forever, there is only never. It is much safer for me to just close every door between outside and myself I believe.
