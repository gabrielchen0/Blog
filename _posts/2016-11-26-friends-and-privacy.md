Now I am lying on the bed with wine, and I do enjoy having the holiday for Thanksgiving. However, something came into my mind yesterday. Last night, I was in someone else's bed instead of mine. Although we did not do something too awkward to break our relationship, she asked me something about my stuff, and this makes me wonder which one I should choose, friends, or my privacy. 

I met her several months ago, and we start knowing each other recently. We went to Hess Collection for the first time during the Halloween, and we went to James’s talk in San Francisco together. I do not know why she keeps coming to me again and again, and I do not know if this is friendship or not. But this relationship had not bothered me until last night. 

Last night, we slept together, and many things changed. She asked me MANY questions about myself, and I even suspected that she is sent from someone else. All those questions are about my privacy, and even though I did not answer all of them and rest of them have answered ambiguously, I still feel that some of my own parts have been invented. Many things I should not have told her, but I said that without conscious at two o’clock in the morning. 

Probably, this is what they called friendship. Friends mean know each other, understand each other, and help each other. I have to say that I do not like it, and I never know someday I will get involved into it. She always says I am like the person she used to be, but I know that I am the person she always wants to be actually. I am not sure whether she falls in love with me or not because I can feel that she might like me, but she refuses to admit it, and I know this means love even I cannot love the human. 

People are always a mystery to me. I play chess to remind myself that I should never treat real people in that cruel way even I could. But there are so many people are trying to learn how to treat others in that way. I do feel a little emotion, but they say I care about people. People who can feel a lot are said no care to others, which I cannot understand why.

She said the reason that she is willing to become my friend is that I never care, and even if one day she leaves, I will not be hurt. I do not believe that. I believe that she is going to make me care, and she is not leaving until I care. This is amusing to everyone except me. They just feel sad with losing control, and they will try their best to gain the power to control. 

Such People.
